You may also download the replay, in a .rofl file, for later viewing.\r\n\r\nThis program takes a .rofl file as input and extracts out the replay's chunk and keyframe data. The chunk and\r\nkeyframe data are what the League of Legends client uses to re-enact a given replay.\r\n\r\nAn additional project, the [LeagueChunkReader](https://github.com/ryancole/LeagueChunkReader), aims to read\r\nand make sense of the chunk and keyframe data.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
